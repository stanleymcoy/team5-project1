Playcation

# Project Description: 
An app that produces a virtual musical vacation. Users can select a destination from the dropdown menu to see images, weather reports, and a playlist of the most popular tracks in that location. 

# User Story: 
As a person who is stuck in their home, I want to imagine that I can travel to far away places so I can experience new sights and sounds.
