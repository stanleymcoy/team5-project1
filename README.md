First Team Project


# Project Title: 
Playcation

# Project Description: 
An app that produces a virtual musical vacation. Users can search for a place to visit or click on popular locations on a map to see images, weather reports, and a playlist of the most popular songs in that place that day. 

# User Story: 
As a person who is stuck in their home, I want to imagine that I can travel to far away places so I can experience new sights and sounds.
